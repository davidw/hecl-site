      The Hecl Programming Language is a high-level scripting
      language implemented in Java.  It is intended to be
      small, extensible, extremely flexible, and easy to learn
      and use.
    </p>
    <p>
      I personally can't stand web pages for new programming
      languages without a quick link to some examples.  Here
      you are: <a href="hecl_examples.html">Hecl Examples</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Why Hecl?</b>  Hecl is intended as a complement to the Java
      programming language, not a replacement.  As such, it
      tries to do well what Java doesn't, and leaves those
      tasks to Java for which it is best suited.  Hecl aims to
      be a very immediate language - you can pick it up and
      start doing useful things with it quickly.  It is also
      meant to be easy to learn.  Where Java is verbose and
      rigid, Hecl is forgiving and quick to write.  For
      instance,
      <code>System.out.println("Hello&nbsp;World");</code> vs
      <code>puts "Hello&nbsp;World"</code> - 41 keystrokes
      (shifted letters count double) versus 22.  Hecl is built
      to <a href="http://dedasys.com/articles/scalable_systems.html">"scale
	down"</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This makes Hecl ideal for large applications written in Java
      that would like to provide a user friendly scripting interface,
      rather than, say, a clunky XML based configuration system.
      Examples include: scripted web pages, command/control logic in
      long running applications, and, I'm sure, many environments I've
      never considered.
    </p>

    <div class="example">
      <table style="border-width: medium; border-collapse: no;">
	<tbody>
	  <tr>
	    <th colspan="2">Hecl example app for J2ME</th>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td style="padding: 1ex;"><img style="border: solid black 1px;" src="screen1.png" alt="Hecl code on cell phone"></td>
	    <td style="padding: 1ex;"><img style="border: solid black 1px;" src="screen2.png" alt="Results of hecl code"></td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td style="padding: 1ex;">Edit the code...</td>
	    <td style="padding: 1ex;">... and run it!</td>
	  </tr>
	</tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p>
      Hecl is also a small language with a minimal core.  The
      idea is to provide only what's necessary in the language
      itself, and as needed, add in extensions for specific
      tasks.  Core Hecl is small enough to run on my Nokia
      3100 cell phone as a J2ME application, presenting the
      interesting possibility of writing scripts, or at some
      point, maybe even scripting entire applications, for
      devices running embedded Java.  As an example, you can
      try this MIDlet: <a
	href="/files/Hecl.jar">Hecl.jar</a> <a
	href="/files/Hecl.jad">Hecl.jad</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Licensing</b>: Hecl is available under the liberal <a
      href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0
      license</a>.  Which says, more or less, that you may use Hecl in
      your own applications, even if they are not open source.  You
      have to give me credit, though.  Read the license itself to
      clear up any doubts.
